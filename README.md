Virtaul Therapist
-----------------
Virtual Therapist is a platform for analysing and managing usege of the 
Virtual Therapist App.

Setup
-----
Copy `conf/application.conf.example` and to `conf/application.conf` and edit 
the database credentials to your needs. If you are a Unix user edit only 
`db.default.url`:

    db.default.url="mysql://user:password@localhost/datatabse"

If you are Windows user set the following settings:
    
    db.default.url="jdbc:mysql://3306/database"
    db.default.user="user"
    db.default.password="password"

Make sure the database exists, during start of the application the tables will
be created automatically.

When in production edit `application.secret` and set a unique key.

Start development server
------------------------
Start the webapp for development using [`activator`][1]:

    $ activator run

By default the application listens on port 9000 of your machine.


Start production server
-----------------------
First, make sure you've a set a application secret. Of cource, do not use the secret
in that
It's not recommmanded to start the server in production using `$activator run`.
["Play checks with SBT to see if any files have changed, and this may have significant performance impacts on your application."][2]

Clean the application by removing caches and compiled stuff. Now prepare the application
using the `stage` task.

    $ activator clean stage

An executable has been placed in `target/universal/stage/bin/` directory. Use this executable
to start the server.

    $ target/universal/stage/bin/virtualcoach-web -Dpidfile.path=/tmp/play.pid > /dev/null 2>&1 &

Stopping the server is easy:

    $ kill $(cat /tmp/play.pid)
